🚀 Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions using Deep Learning

A comparative study using CNN, LSTM, and Random Forest models to detect fraudulent financial transactions.

📂 Project Overview
This project explores how different machine learning and deep learning models can detect fraud in highly imbalanced financial datasets.
We compare:

🧠 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

🧩 Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

🌳 Random Forest Classifier (baseline)

The results, visualizations, and code snippets are documented in a LaTeX-based academic report.

📈 Key Insights
CNN delivered the best overall accuracy and training speed.

LSTM models performed well but had higher computational costs.

Random Forest provided strong baseline performance without GPU needs.

SMOTE significantly improved recall on minority (fraudulent) class.

🔥 Future Directions
Develop hybrid CNN-LSTM models for improved learning of spatial and temporal patterns.

Integrate explainable AI tools (SHAP, LIME) for model interpretability.
